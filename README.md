# PaperServerUpdater
Simple bash script that shows changelogs from the currently installed version of Paper, to the latest version available and then automatically installs the latest version.
If also shows the changelogs from upstream.

The script was designed to be usable in other scripts. It also makes a symlink to the latest build, that has a static name, so you can use that in scripts too.
